# joycam

This project is an upgrade to [adafruit-pi-cam](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-pi-cam) written by PaintYourDragon (Phil B) for Adafruit Industries.

The objective of this project is to work with:
- picamera2
- Raspbian bullseye
- Python 3

This project was also modified to work with the Adafruit Joy Bonnet rather than the touchscreen, but touchscreen functionality is preserved wherever possible and it should not be too difficult to port it back in if you so choose. 

Although I am testing this only on the Joy Bonnet with a screen resolution of 240x240 pixels, other screen resolutions should be supported out of the box.
